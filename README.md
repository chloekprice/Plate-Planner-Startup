# Startup
Startup project called "Plate Planner" made in conjunction with CS 260 (Web Programming).
## Startup Specification
### Elevator Pitch
Imagine that it is the end of the week and your refrigerator is absolutely bare. You do not have a ton of time to take inventory of what you little you do have and what is most important for you to get for the coming week, so you jot down a few items on a list and head to the store. While at the store, you pull out the crumpled piece of paper that was once your shopping list. You struggle through the store until you fill a shopping cart. Once home, you remember all the items you forgot you needed. And during the coming week, you find that you do not have the ingredients necessary to make actual meals--you reluctantly resolve to eating PB&Js for the rest of the week. We have all been here. Planning out future meals and making a comprehensive list BEFORE grocery shopping is the ideal, but it seems too overwhelming. With the Plate Planner application, that struggle is gone! In one, easy to use app, you can easily plan meals for an entire week. The application will then automatically generate a list of items you need at the store. It is as easy as that!
